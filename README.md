# Ethereum Dapp for Tracking Items through Supply Chain
Project for Udacity - Blockchain Developer Nanodegree.
Boilerplate code provided [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd1309-Project-6b-Example-Template)

#### Project general write-up:
Project is build in accordance to plan provided by Udacity - Project Details.
Project has been divided to multiple building parts:
- 1 Plan the project. I added UML diagrams required in specification. 
- 2 Write smart contracts: Based on the boilerplate and specifications, I added the required code for the smart contract.
- 3 Test smart contract code coverage: Based on the boilerplate and specifications, I added the required code for test coverage ensuring all test are passing.
- 4 Deploy smart contracts on Rinkeby: I used the Truffle framework and Infura to deploy my smart contracts onto the Rinkeby test network.
